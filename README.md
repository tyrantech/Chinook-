Okay.This project contains an sqlite database of which is raw and unprocessed. 
sales_report.csv is what came of the sql code uploaded.
Great,now thats out the way. Let me tell you what insights i hoped to get from this project: 

1. Sales Insights

Which countries bring in the most revenue?

Who are the top customers (by purchases/spend)?

Which employees (sales reps) bring in the most sales?

What are the trends in sales by year/month?

2. Music & Artist Insights

Which genres are most popular (by number of tracks sold)?

Who are the top-selling artists/albums?

Are there countries that prefer specific genres/artists?

3. Customer Behavior

Average spend per customer.

Repeat customers vs. one-time buyers.

Customers grouped by country â€” where should the business expand?

4. Operational Insights

Which employees manage the highest revenue customers?

*** While this does feel complete for now, as i grow in skill i'll probably want to add to this list
and this project.
